After we were given negative feedback about our cat typing theme, we decided to go with an ocean theme and ocean color scheme. 
      To solidify the theme we first added a squiggly underline under our header, which looks like waves on an ocean. Then we 
      added a relaxing photo of the ocean to as our background. We then added a blue color scheme which matched the color of the 
      ocean in the photo. To make the website easier to navigate we added a colored textbox to surround each class session which 
      varied in color. We chose the Stencil Std and fantasy fonts because they looked the most relaxing. We added overflow to the 
      text boxed to make the website to avoid crowding within the boxes. We found the public image at the address https://www.pexels.com/photo/ocean-wave-1656579
